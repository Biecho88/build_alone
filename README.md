- ## *Design*

- ### Color scheme

    #### Background Color: An evening-themed picture from a construction area where heavy machinery is working is creating a dynamic and engaging backdrop for the website. It not only sets the tone for the industry but also adds visual interest and context to the content. With such a background, the dark tones from the evening theme provide a suitable base for the contrast needed to make white containers stand out, ensuring that information and features are easily readable and accessible to visitors. It can also evoke a sense of activity and productivity, which aligns well with the purpose of your website.
   

    #### Container Color: The containers housing the information and features are white. This creates a clean, crisp look that stands out against the dark background. White containers can also help to ensure that text and images are easily readable and visually distinct.

    #### Text Color: Text within the white containers is black. A classic choice that provides high contrast against the white background.


- #### Typography
  
    Lato font is the main font used throughout the whole website with sans-serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

- #### Icons

    Font Awesome icons have been used to style the page to boost user experience.

## Django Framework explained:

#### Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Its primary purpose is to simplify the creation of complex, database-driven websites by providing a robust set of tools and conventions for handling common web development tasks.

#### Here are some of the key purposes and capabilities of the Django framework:

    1. Rapid Development: Django follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, which means developers can write clean, concise code without redundancy. Its built-in features, such as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) and automatic admin interface, help developers build applications quickly.

    2. Scalability: Django is designed to scale efficiently, making it suitable for projects of all sizes. Its modular structure and support for reusable apps allow developers to build and maintain large-scale applications with ease.

    3. ORM (Object-Relational Mapper): Django's ORM allows developers to interact with the database using Python objects, abstracting away the complexity of SQL queries. This makes database operations more intuitive and reduces the risk of SQL injection attacks.

    4. Admin Interface: Django provides an automatic admin interface for managing site content, which is generated based on the data models defined in the application. This allows developers to quickly create a fully-featured administrative interface without writing any code.

    5. Security: Django comes with built-in security features to help developers build secure web applications. It provides protection against common web security threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and clickjacking.

    6. URL Routing: Django's URL routing system allows developers to map URLs to views, making it easy to create clean and readable URL structures for their applications.
    
    7. Template Engine: Django includes a powerful template engine that allows developers to build dynamic web pages using HTML templates with Python-like syntax. This separation of logic and presentation helps maintain clean and maintainable code.

    8. Community and Ecosystem: Django has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its ecosystem by creating reusable apps, extensions, and libraries. This makes it easy for developers to find solutions to common problems and leverage existing code.

#### Overall, Django is well-suited for building a wide range of web applications, from simple blogs to complex enterprise-level systems, thanks to its simplicity, flexibility, and scalability.

## PEP8 Python style guide explained - 
PEP 8 is a style guide for writing Python code. PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, and it's a design document providing information or describing a new feature for Python or its processes. PEP 8 specifically focuses on the style conventions for writing Python code in a way that is readable and consistent.

- Here's an overview of some of the key points covered in PEP 8:

- Indentation: Python code should be indented using 4 spaces per indentation level. Tabs should not be used for indentation.

- Line Length: Lines of code should be limited to 79 characters. However, this is not a strict rule, and lines can be up to 120 characters if necessary, but should be avoided when possible.

- Blank Lines: Use blank lines to separate functions, classes, and blocks of code within functions to improve readability.

- Imports: Import statements should usually be on separate lines and should import only one module per line. Standard library imports should be grouped before third-party library imports.

- Whitespace: Surround operators with whitespace, but don't use extraneous whitespace. Also, avoid trailing whitespace at the end of lines.

- Naming Conventions: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and modules. Variables and functions should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores (snake_case). Classes should be capitalized (CamelCase).

- Comments: Write comments to explain the purpose of the code when necessary. Comments should be clear and concise. Inline comments should be used sparingly and should be preceded by at least two spaces.

- Documentation Strings: Use docstrings to document modules, classes, functions, and methods. Docstrings should be enclosed in triple quotes (""").

- Function and Method Arguments: Don't put spaces around the = sign when used to indicate a keyword argument or a default parameter value.

- Constants: Constants should be defined using all capital letters with underscores separating words.

These are just some of the key points from PEP 8. Adhering to these style conventions helps make Python code more readable and maintainable, especially in collaborative projects where consistency is important.

### Known Bugs

- The billing information on checkout_success.html is not correctly calculating totals. This calculation was working in the virtual environment but ceased functioning once the app was deployed to Heroku. The reason for this issue is unknown. Additionally, the display of this information on the profile page, where historical orders of the user are listed, is also incorrect.
